When I give improvement instructions, follow the steps below:
	1.	Create a markdown file named "feedback_${timeStamp}.md" in the @documents folder.
	2.	In that file, organize each improvement point using the as-is / to-be format.
	3.	After listing all points, create a to-do list to address them.
	4.	From the to-do list, group only the items that can be handled together in one step, apply the changes, and ask me for feedback.
	5.	Based on my response, proceed as follows:
	•	(5-1) If the changes are confirmed as complete: check if there are remaining to-dos. If so, repeat from step 4.
	•	(5-2) If the changes are not approved: update the markdown file with revised improvement points and a new to-do list based on a revised strategy, then repeat from step 4.
